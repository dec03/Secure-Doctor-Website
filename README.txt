This project that was done in my second year of university,
the aim of this was to create a secure doctor website with encryption and hashing.
It also had to communicate with the database in the backend whilst also updating 
the website with live information. For this to work, a database needs to be created,
either on PHPmyadmin or through MySQLworkbench.
