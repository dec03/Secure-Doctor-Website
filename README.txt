This project that was done in my second year of university, the aim of this was 
to create a secure doctor website with encryption and hashing. It also had to 
communicate with the database in the backend whilst also updating the website 
with live information. For this to work, a database needs to be created, either
on PHPmyadmin or through MySQLworkbench. If your'e going to run the code on 
your system, the variables $username, $database and $password in the PHP files
need to be set to the same configuration as your database (the username to 
access it, the name of the database, the password to that database). The SQL 
file also needs to contain the name of the database you want to create, which
should be commented in the first statments/queries.
