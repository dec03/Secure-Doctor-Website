This project that was done in my second year of university, the aim of this was 
to create a secure doctor website with encryption and hashing. It also had to 
communicate with the database in the backend whilst also updating the website 
with live information. For this to work, a database needs to be created, either
on PHPmyadmin or through MySQLworkbench. If your'e going to run the code on 
your system, the variables $username, $database and $password need to be 
set to the same configuration as your database (the username to access it,
the name of the database, the password to that database).
